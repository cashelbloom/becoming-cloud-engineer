Hello All,
I have pushed multiple files today to the main branch for becoming-cloud-engineer rep in github.com. 
You can pull the updates using the git commands to your branch - if you have one.
	Here are the sequence of commands if you have your branch locally:

1. change directory to the root of your local branch, using gitbash
	for example, if you have cloned the 'becoming-cloud-engineer' project to your c:/gitrepos/becoming-cloud-engineer -then c:/gitrepos/becoming-cloud-engineer -Once you execute this on your gitbash CLI (command line interface), you will see:
	c:/gitrepos/becoming-cloud-engineer(your branch name in green)

2. execute git status . (there is a dot after a blank space after status)
	This will list the files that have been created, modified, and / or deleted in your local branch

3. To accept all the changes listed, run the command:
	git add .
	(there is a dot after a blank space after add)

4. run the command: git commit -m 'put some comments here between a pair of quotes'

5. Now run the command: git checkout main
	this will change the branch in your workspace to main

6 Now run the command: git pull origin man
	this will get all the latest files in the remote main branch to your local main branch

7. Now run the command: git checkout yourlocalbranch
	this will get your local branch to the workspace, replacing the main branch from your workspace

8. Now run the command: git merge main
	this will get all the latest files from your local main to your local branch.

With the above steps, now your local branch in local workspace will have the latest from the main branch in the github.com server
