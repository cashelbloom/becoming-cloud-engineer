Global Chess League System:
    Core Functionalities Needed:
        1. Hold the data about each player, part of the league
        2. Hold the data about team composition of all the 6 teams
        3. Create a schedule of matches for both the round robins for all the teams
            a. Schedule should hold data about:
                Date of a Match
                Time of Match
                Teams Playing in a Match
                Color Assigned to Each Team in a Match
            b. Be able to display the schedule for a given date
                The Data to Display are:
                    Data of Match
                    Time of Match (as Matches are played one after another)
                    Pairing for Each Match
                    Color of Each Team
        4. For each match, store the results
            a. After each match add the board points to:
                The Player
                The Team
            b. Points award rules - Players:
                If a player played with White color pieces, a win for that player will get 3 points
                If a player played with Black color pieces, a win for that player will get 4 points
                If the game ended in a draw, both players will get 1 point each
                A player who lost their game will get 0 points
            c. Points award rules - Teams:
                The team whose sum of all the board points for a given match is higher than the other team's:
                    3 Match Points are Awarded
                    0 Match Points are Awarded to the team with lower points
                In case both teams have the same number of game points, then each team will be awarded 1 point.
            d. After each match add the match points to:
                Each Team
            e. After each match add the sum of the game points for that match to the sum of the game points of
                all the previous matches

        5. Provide current position of each team
            a. Display teams in the order of the match points in DESCENDING Order
            b. If two teams are tied in match points, use team game points to decide who would come before the other
        6. Provide current position of each board
            a. The board numbering is as below:
                The Icon Board
                The SuperStarMen 1 Board
                The SuperStarMen 2 Board
                The SuperStarWomen 1 Board
                The SuperStarWomen 2 Board
