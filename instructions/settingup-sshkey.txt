Adding SSH Key to SSH Agent:
	# start the ssh-agent in the background
	$ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
	> Agent pid 59566

	Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent. If you created your key with a different name, or if you are adding an existing key that has a different name, replace id_ed25519 in the command with the name of your private key file.

	$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

	$ clip < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
	# Copies the contents of the id_ed25519.pub file to your clipboard
