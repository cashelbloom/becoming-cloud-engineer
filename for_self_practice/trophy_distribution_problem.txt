05/22/23 - Program Exercise:
-------------------------------
Create a flow chart for the Trophy Distribution Scenario:
	You have 3 high-priced candy bars that you want to hand out to 3 deserving students.
	You have the following points table to use to determine the top 3 students.
	Attribute							Points
	Academic Excellence 		AE		10
	Sports Excellence			SE		8
	Club Participation			CP		8
	Social Interaction			SI		8
	Leadership Demonstration	LD		8
	
	Here are the 10 short-listed students and their respective points under each category:
	Student-ID	AE		SE		CP		SI		LD
	1			9		8		8		6		7 = 38
	2			10		8		7		7		7 = 39 + 2 = 41 III
	3			9		7		7		8		7 = 38
	4			8		8		7		7		8 = 38
	5			9		8		6		8		7 = 38
	6			8		8		8		8		7 = 39
	7			9		7		8		7		8 = 39
	8			10		7		7		8		8 = 40 + 42 I
	9			9		7		8		7		8 = 39
	10			9		8		7		8		8 = 40  II

	
	In the event of tie, the tie breakers are:
		1. The one who has higher AE score will be awarded 2 extra points
		2. If still there is a tie, then the one with higher LD score will get 2 extra points
		3. If there is still tie for a position, then the one with higher SE will get 2 extra points.
	Use efficient data structure to program a solution for this scenario.
(I have created this scenario for Becoming Cloud Engineering Training course)

05/22/23 - Flow Chart Exercise:
-------------------------------
Create a flow chart to determine who in a class of 50 students the tallest. Use your own logic to draw the flow to print the tallest person in the class.
