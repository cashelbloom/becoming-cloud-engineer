'''
When we want to call json.loads(variable)
    The imporntan point we should remember is that the variable should be in JSON format
        JSON format means each key and non-numeric values should be enclosed in DOUBLE QUOTES
        If the key and non-numeric value are enclosed in SINGLE QUOTES, the json.loads(variable) WILL FAIL.
