Problems for your practice:
	1. Store the 4 primitive data types (str, int, float, bool) and the 2 advance data types (list and dict) in a list. Now, using "for" loop, print each of the types with this verbiage: 
		1. str is for String values.
		2. int is for Integer values.
		3. float is for Decimal values.
		4. bool is for Boolean values
		5. list is for collection of values, accessed by index.
		6. dict is also for collection of values; but each value is stored with a corresponding key. There CAN NOT be duplicate keys in a dict data type.
