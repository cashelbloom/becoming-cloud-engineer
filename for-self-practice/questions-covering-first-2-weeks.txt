1. First you try on your own as much as possible.
2. Whatever you are able to complete coding for, save the .py file

Problems for your practice:
	1. Store the 4 primitive data types (str, int, float, bool) and the 2 advance data types (list and dict) in a list. Now, using "for" loop, print each of the types with this verbiage: 
		1. str is for String values.
		2. int is for Integer values.
		3. float is for Decimal values.
		4. bool is for Boolean values
		5. list is for collection of values, accessed by index.
		6. dict is also for collection of values; but each value is stored with a corresponding key. There CAN NOT be duplicate keys in a dict data type.
 (The knowledge area covered in the above practice problem:
	1. Creating a list variable and initializing values in it.
	2. Coding a "for" loop and iterating thru the list
	3. Using the "item" (a variable in the for loop) to call in the print statement.
	4. Making use of the index value to print the serial number (such 1, 2, and so on).

	2. Use a function to get the output of the above question.
		1. The function will have 2 parameters, 'data_types' 'data_type_desc
			data_types will have the names of data types as in Python language
			data_type_desc will have the description for each of data types
