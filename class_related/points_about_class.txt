classes in Python:
keyword: class 
name: PascalCase

built-in function: __init__(self, param1,...)
	initialize the parameters included in the param list as:
		self.param1 = 'afdf'
		and so on
the __init__ is something like constructor in Java.

the params are the attributes of the class

You have to instantiate a class to bring to life an object of that class - remember the architect, builder, and a customer


__str__ built-in function:

self - can be any name. But it has to be the first parameter as the class is defined and in any function parameter list.

			child class declaration:
				class MaleVoter(Voter):
